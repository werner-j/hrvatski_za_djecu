## What You Have

âœ… Complete curriculum for 36 weeks (12 units)
âœ… Professional LaTeX book structure
âœ… One fully developed unit as example
âœ… 36+ development tasks ready to go

```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub (first time only)
gh auth login

# Create all 36 issues
python3 create_issues.py
```

### 4. Start Developing

Pick an issue from Sprint 1 and start working! 

## File Guide

- **CURRICULUM.md** - What each unit should teach
- **ISSUES.md** - All development tasks listed

## Common Tasks

### Add Content to a Unit

1. Open the unit file (e.g., `chapters/unit02_family.tex`)
2. Follow the structure from Unit 1
3. Use the custom boxes:
   - `\begin{vocabulary}...\end{vocabulary}` for vocab

   - `\begin{culture}...\end{culture}` for culture
   - `\begin{exercise}...\end{exercise}` for exercises
4. Rebuild: `make`

### Add Images

1. Put images in `images/` folder
2. Reference in LaTeX: `\includegraphics{images/filename.png}`
3. Rebuild: `make`

### Test Your Changes

```bash
make clean  # Clean old files
make        # Rebuild
make view   # Open PDF
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Pick an issue** from your GitHub issues
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/unit-2-content`
3. **Make changes** to relevant .tex files
4. **Test**: `make` and review the PDF
5. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Add family vocabulary to Unit 2"`
6. **Push**: `git push`
7. **Create PR** for review

## Need Help?

- **Read CURRICULUM.md** for what each unit needs

2. Create pronunciation guide
3. Design visual elements and style guide

## Tips for Success

- **Test frequently** - build after every major change
- **Use the boxes** - they make content organized and colorful
- **Add exercises** - practice is essential
